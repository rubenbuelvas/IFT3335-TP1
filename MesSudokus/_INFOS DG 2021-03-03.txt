Improved random.choice in order to avoid selecting a square already solved (useless loop)
Improved the display function in order to display only if t > parameter
Improved the method search by adding a new parameter searchMethod
searchMethods = {'Brute Force', 'Norvig Heuristic', 'Norvig Improved'}
Function solve_all:
- Added statistics total time, counttotalsearches, countnakedimprovements 
- Debugged when time was 0.0 (division by zero error)

Coded a heuristic called findbettersquarewithpairsandtriples but still unsure about efficiency (found only 145 optimizations)

def findbettersquarewithpairsandtriples(s, values, printwhenfound=True): #DGNEW    <--------------- THIS CODE CAN BE OPTIMIZED
    """Will use naked pairs in order to identify a better square to use if possible.
       Inspired by https://www.sudokuoftheday.com/techniques/naked-pairs-triples/"""
