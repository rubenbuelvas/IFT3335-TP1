* TODO introduction : brief description of the work realised

* Q2
The performance of the Norvig algorithm without heuristic is, at least in the cases we tried, always worse than the one
that used some kind of heuristic. On average, it took twice as much time to solve the problem without the help of the
heuristic. However, even if twice is not that bad, in the worse case scenarios we could get around five times the time.
As it is true in many other cases, there's no reason whatsoever to not use a heuristic when available.
TODO Check numbers

* TODO choice of heuristics for Q3


* TODO comparison of different methods in terms of performance
+ indicate how to run each algorithm
